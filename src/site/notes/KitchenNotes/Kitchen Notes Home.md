I started this Obsidian note as the home of my notes about what I do and observe in the kitchen, to keep a record, to avoid any misunderstanding or miscommunication about my use of the shared kitchen. 

Hierarchical notes based on date. On the Month level I also include a table to see major tasks at a glance.
